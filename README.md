## Dev notes

### Local setup

Local backend needs `node.js` and `MySQL`. That's it, well therethen there's the infinite `node_modules` hope, but meh - that's a broader topic.

**All local**

0. `cd backend` and have `MySQL` running
1. Install dependencies `npm i`
2. Copy and update variables in `cp example.env .env`
3. Update `Prisma client` to your machine with `npx prisma generate`
4. Run the migrations and seed `npx prisma migrate reset -y`
5. Finally build `npm run build` and serve with `npm run start`
6. Also do the setup the **analyzer** for real scores

**Docker**

0. `cd backend`
1. Run docker compose with `docker compose up -d`

### To test analyzer

1. Install `Python 3.12`, `opencv-python` & `mediapipe` libs. Needs to have `ffmpeg` and a few other things, that msot probably are already installed by default.
2. Check for media file paths at `./testpyvid.js`
3. Test the `python-in-node` execution with simple command `node testpyvid.js`
